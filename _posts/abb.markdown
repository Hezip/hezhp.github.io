  During the internship at ABB, I mainly learned to use BLAM to do the localization. The general process framework of BLAM is as follows: The input is a 16-line lidar. After filtering, the relative transform is initialized by matching between neighbor lidar scans. This initial transform is used to transform the point cloud of the current scan to the world coordinate to find the nearest neighbor point. A GICP algorithm is running between the current scan and the neighbor points to get an accurate transformation. At the same time, it uses GTSAM for loop detection, and after detecting the loop, performs factor graph optimization and recalculates the pose of robot through SLAM ++.
